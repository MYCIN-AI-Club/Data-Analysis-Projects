All 107 people aboard were safely evacuated off the plane without injury. According to the NTSB, the captain said he was making a coupled approach, but because of problems with his pressure altimeter, he was relying on the more accurate radio altimeter for verification of altitude. The captain looked up expecting to be 200 feet above the water but instead was nearly in the water. He applied power but it was too late. The captain did not cross-check the raw data glide-slope signals and didn't realize the ILS on-course position was far above where he was. The  improper application of the prescribed procedures to execute an automatic-coupled ILS approach. This deviation from the prescribed procedures was, in part, due t o a lack of familiarization and infrequent operation of the installed flight director and autopilot system.  As a result, Japan Air Lines changed their training procedures to stress command responsibilities, crew coordination and transition time for new type of aircraft. The aircraft was recovered from the San Francisco Bay 55 hours after the accident, repaired at a United Air Lines facility and eventually flow back to Japan where it was put  in service for many decades."

Insects had buried eggs in her skin and they were beginning to hatch. One of the men poured gasoline on her and, as she told the London Daily Mail, 'I counted 35 worms that came out of my arms alone.'

However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor.

The reason for this was the radar tracker ball was left in the vicinity of the Bandar Abbas airport and the radar was picking up both the airliner and a military F-14 jet fighter at the same time. Playing it safe, the plane was misidentified as a F-14 Iranian fighter. The aircraft did not respond to 10 radio challenges from the Vincennes. However, 7 were on military frequencies which the airliner could not pick up. Three were on the civil emergency frequency addressed to the so called military F-14. When the plane was nearing 10 miles from the ship, it was reported to the captain that the aircraft was descending. At that time the surface-to-air missiles were fired destroying the aircraft. At the inquiry computer data showed that the plane was never descending and actually was ascending at a steady rate. Incredibly, a military investigation concluded that although the U.S. government regretted the loss of human life, the captain and crew were not at fault and acted properly in shooting down the airliner."

The captain speaking very little English and communicating through the first officer, at no time declared an emergency. The first officer used the term 'we need priority' several times, rather than declaring an emergency. The ATC did not realize the peril of the aircraft. Failure of the crew to properly communicate the emergency situation to the ATC. Although blame was placed squarely on the crew there are several reasons why ATC should have  taken some responsibility for the accident. ATC was trying to land too many planes at once given the weather and number of missed approaches and aborted landing that were taking place. The plane was put in an extended holding pattern on three different occasions. The crew was not told of wind shear below 500 ft. which led to the aborted landing attempt. The plane was passed between three different controllers as it came out of its holding pattern to land. Each time the crew had to repeat their fuel situation.  The crew did say 'we are running out of fuel' numerous times only to be taken on a wide circling pattern after the first attempt at landing was aborted.

The pilot's 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot's seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard.

The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence."

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists."

However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight."

Shortly after taking off a fourth time, witnesses heard the engine make popping noises, bank to the right, pitch up, and go into a steep dive from about a  500 foot altitude and crash into the sea about 150 yards offshore. Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge."

The Indonesian National Transportation Committee found that there was insufficient evidence to find a cause for the accident. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board strongly disagreed and stated the jet's cockpit voice recorder was intentionally disconnected and its flight controls placed in a nose-down position most likely by the captain. While the U.S. NTSB stopped short of using the term suicide, its dissenting report made it clear it believed the crash was the result of actions by the captain.

The crew then advised ATC that the left engine had been shut down because it was on fire. The crew decided to proceed to Mirabel International Airport. Then crew then advised ATC that the engine fire was out. On final for Runway 24, the crew advised ATC that the left engine was again on fire. The landing gear was extended on short final, and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards. The fuselage inverted, struck the runway and slid 2,500 feet and came to rest on the left side of the runway.  PC: The crew did not realize that the pull to the left and the extended take-off run were due to the left brakes' dragging, which led to overheating of the brake components. The dragging caused overheating and leakage, probably at one of the piston seals that retain the brake hydraulifluid. When hydraulifluid leaked onto the hot brake components, the fluid caught fire and initiated an intense fire in the left nacelle, leading to failure of the main hydraulisystem. When the L WING OVHT light went out, the overheating problem appeared corrected; however, the fire continued to burn. The crew never realized that all of the problems were associated with a fire in the wheel well, and they did not realize how serious the situation was. The left wing was weakened by the wing/engine fire and failed, rendering the aircraft uncontrollable."

Loss of airplane pitch control resulting from in-flight failure of the horizontal stabilizer trim system jackscrew assembly's acme nut thread. The component failed because of excessive wear resulting from Alaska Airlines' insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly. Contributing to the accident were Alaska Airlines' extended lubrication interval and the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of that extension, which increased the likelihood that a missed or inadequate lubrication would result in excessive wear of the acme nut threads and Alaska Airlines' extended end play check interval and the FAA's approval of that extension, which allowed the excessive wear of the acme nut threads to progress to failure without the opportunity for detection. Also contributing to the accident was the absence on the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 of a fail-safe mechanism to prevent the catastrophieffects of total acme nut thread loss.

The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air trafficontroller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air trafficontroller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air trafficontroller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings.

It was only when one engine failed from fuel starvation that the computer-controlled systems aboard the plane unlocked the door. The plane continued on track until it crashed into mountainous terrain about 25 miles north of Athens. CVR tapes showed that a student pilot/flight attendant, Andreas Prodromos, was at the controls of the aircraft and tried to send a Mayday message twice but the radio was set to the wrong frequency. The cabin pressure control was left in the manual, instead of auto position by maintenance workers. The error was not picked up by the two pilots during three subsequent check lists.

Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident. The plane had circled the airport for 30 to 35 minutes before attempting to land. The pilots' failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the airplane after landing, which resulted in a runway overrun. This failure occurred because the pilots' first experience and lack of familiarity with the airplane's autobrake system distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing. Contributing to the accident were Southwest Airline's 1) failure to provide its pilots with clear and consistent guidance and training regarding company policies and procedures related to arrival landing distance calculations; 2) programming and design of its onboard performance computer, which did not present inherent assumptions in the program critical to pilot decision making; 3) plan to implement new autobrake procedures without a familiarization period; and 4) failure to include a margin of safety in the arrival assessment to account for operational uncertainties. Also contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to divert to another airport given reports that included poor braking action and a tailwind component greater than 5 knots. Contributing to the severity of the accident was the absence of an engineering materials arresting system, which was needed because of the limited runway safety area beyond the departure end of runway 31C."

While cruising at this altitude, the aircraft was caught in a violent gust that initially pushed the plane upwards and towards the mountain. As the pilot tried to steer the aircraft away from the mountain, he realized that the airspeed had decayed to 40 kts., indicating an imminent stall. He decided to dive in order to gain air speed. As he did so the VSI indicated a rate of sink of 2,000 feet per minute while the airspeed remained at 40 kts. Visibility was poor and the pilot did not see the ground till impact at 14,399 feet. Four Italian tourists were killed. Only the pilot survived. It is therefore very likely that the aircraft was caught in a mountain wave that caused the sudden altitude gain and the subsequent stall."
